## [Travelchat](https://travel-chat.herokuapp.com/)
My first NodeJS application for people who are traveling. 
>The application is under development.

## Stack technologies:
- Express 4 and socket.io for server; 
- MongoDB as a database;
- Mongoose for database management;
- Jade(Pug) for templates;
- Webpack 2 for build JavaScript;
- Gulp 4 for build all frontend;
- Mocha and Chai for tests.

## Usage guide:
- `$ npm install` - install dependencies;
- `$ npm run server` - serve at `localhost:5000`;
- `$ npm run database` - start MongoDB;
- `$ npm run dev` - build for development;
- `$ npm run build` - build for production;
- `$ npm test` - run all tests;
- `$ npm run push` - commit all changes and push to github;
- `$ npm run heroku` - deploy to heroku.
